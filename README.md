## Overview

This plugin provides a developer focused interface to commonly used filters without the need
of being fully accessible and skipping the need of providing a streamlined used experience.
It's meant to be an easy way to solve common issues without code changes.

## Documentation

ElasticPress Labs acts as a ElasticPress feature and registers its methods through the
[ElasticPress Feature

features added to this plugin will be immediately available in the ElasticPress interface.

This plugin provides a simple interface to enable and disable features.
