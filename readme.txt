A developer-focused interface to enabling experimental ElasticPress plugin features.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a developer-focused interface to commonly used filters without the need of being fully accessible and skipping the need of providing a streamlined user experience. It's meant to be an easy way to solve common issues without code changes.

ElasticPress Labs acts as an ElasticPress feature and registers its methods through the [ElasticPress Feature API](http://10up.github.io/ElasticPress/tutorial-feature-api.html). In this way the features added to this plugin will be immediately available in the ElasticPress interface.

This plugin provides a simple interface to enable and disable features.
